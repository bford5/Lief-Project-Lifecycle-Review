# Lief Project Lifecycle Review

Lief (read "leaf") was a full-stack web platform I led for the U.S. cannabis dispensary market, comprising a B2B marketing site and a white-label template system. The platform featured "Shipyard", a 3-tier component architecture (Widgets, Components, Layouts) with 70+ parts and 6 pre-built themes. Built on Astro, React, TypeScript, and a self-hosted Directus CMS, it enabled rapid assembly and deployment of visually distinct client websites from a single codebase, reducing per-client turnaround from weeks to days.

This repository is a comprehensive analysis, cleanly organized for ease of viewing, which covers the entire life of the project.
